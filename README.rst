Goals
~~~~~

High level game framework built on top of Unreal Engine.

* Data Driven: focus on the game design
   * Configure your ability in json
   * Bootstrap Game wikis with the raw data

* Multiplayer Ready
   * Hosted
   * Dedicated
   * Standalone

* Ever growing documentation
   * Architecture Diagrams
   * Replication Diagrams
   * Code Search

* Community Friendly
   * Favour source code (C++, HLSL) for easier contribution workflow

* Base UI & Menus for debugging and prototyping

* Automation framework on top of UAT
   * CI/CD
   * Testing Utilities

.. note::

   While the code base favours text code for development and contributions,
   Gamekit makes sure to expose most of the logic to blueprint to extend or customize games
   without going through C++.
