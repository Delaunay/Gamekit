Team Assignment
===============


Game mode is in charge of the team assignment, teams need to be assigned to Pawn (for targeting)
and PlayerControllers. PlayerController team assignment will drive all the logic.


* Assigned from player start: simple method the player start is selected at random
  by the Game mode, the game mode extract the team from the player start and assign it
  to the pawn.

* Assigned by the matchmaker: optimal for balanced games, so teams skill can be as close
  as possible
