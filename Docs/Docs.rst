Documentation
=============

You can use sphinx + doxygen to generate documentation for your project.
Doxygen is used to parse C++ code and extract the docstring into a XML.
Sphinx with the breathe and exhale extensions parse the XML and generate the documentation as HTML.

* Sphinx configuration `example <https://github.com/Delaunay/Gamekit/blob/master/Docs/conf.py>`_
